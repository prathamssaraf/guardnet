# GuardNet Personal Ad Blocker Setup Guide

## 🎯 How GuardNet Blocks Ads System-Wide

GuardNet works at the **DNS level**, which means it blocks ads **before** they even try to load, regardless of which browser or application you use.

### How DNS-Level Ad Blocking Works:

```
1. You type "cnn.com" in your browser
2. Your browser asks: "What's the IP address for cnn.com?"
3. GuardNet checks: "Is cnn.com in our threat database?"
4. GuardNet responds: "Here's the IP: 151.101.193.67" (ALLOWED)

--- BUT WHEN THE PAGE TRIES TO LOAD ADS ---

5. The webpage tries to load "googlesyndication.com" (ads)
6. Your browser asks: "What's the IP for googlesyndication.com?"
7. GuardNet checks: "This is in our ad blocking database!"
8. GuardNet responds: "NXDOMAIN" (BLOCKED - domain doesn't exist)
9. The ad fails to load = cleaner, faster browsing!
```

## 🔧 Setup Options

### Option 1: Quick Test (Current Docker Setup)
Use GuardNet running in Docker containers on your local machine.

**Step 1: Start GuardNet**
```bash
cd D:\gaurdnet
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 2: Configure Your System DNS**

#### Windows:
1. Open Settings → Network & Internet → Wi-Fi (or Ethernet)
2. Click "Change adapter options"
3. Right-click your connection → Properties
4. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" → Properties
5. Select "Use the following DNS server addresses"
6. Primary DNS: `127.0.0.1:8053` (GuardNet)
7. Secondary DNS: `8.8.8.8` (Google backup)
8. Click OK

#### Alternative: Browser-specific DNS (Chrome/Edge)
1. Go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Security
2. Enable "Use secure DNS"
3. Choose "With Custom" → Enter: `127.0.0.1:8053`

### Option 2: Production Setup (Recommended)
Install GuardNet directly on your system or router.

#### On Windows (Native Service):
```bash
# Build native Windows binary
go build -o guardnet-dns.exe ./cmd/server

# Run as Windows service
./guardnet-dns.exe --config=config.yaml
```

#### On Router (OpenWrt/DD-WRT):
- Install GuardNet on your router
- Set router DNS to use GuardNet
- All devices on your network get ad blocking automatically

VALUES ('adult-site.com', 'adult_content', 0.95, 'parental_filter');
```

-- Ensure important sites never get blocked
DELETE FROM threat_domains WHERE domain = 'important-work-site.com';
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Statistics

### Check Blocking Activity:
```bash
# View real-time DNS queries
docker-compose logs dns-filter --follow

# Check statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Database Queries:
```sql
-- See what's being blocked
SELECT domain, threat_type, COUNT(*) as blocked_count 
FROM dns_logs 
WHERE response_type = 'blocked' 
GROUP BY domain, threat_type 
ORDER BY blocked_count DESC;
```

## 📱 Mobile Device Setup

### iOS:
1. Settings → Wi-Fi → Your Network → Configure DNS
2. Manual → Add Server: `YOUR_GUARDNET_IP:8053`

### Android:

5. Save and restart router

**Result**: Every device on your network gets ad blocking automatically!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If a website breaks:
```bash
# Temporarily disable for specific domain
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U guardnet -d guardnet -c "
DELETE FROM threat_domains WHERE domain = 'problematic-site.com';
"
```

### Performance tuning:
```yaml
# config.yaml
cache_ttl: 3600  # Cache blocked domains for 1 hour
upstream_dns: ["1.1.1.1:53", "8.8.8.8:53"]  # Fast upstream DNS
```
